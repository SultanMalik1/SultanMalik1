👋 Hi, I’m Sultan Malik, a Software Engineer specializing in full-stack development. I leverage a broad skill set in programming languages and technologies like JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Next.js, and MongoDB to create impactful web applications. My Bachelor’s in Computer Science from Fordham University underpins my technical expertise and collaborative approach to problem-solving.

🌱 I’m currently learning new technologies and methodologies to enhance my skills and stay updated with industry trends.

💼 As a Software Engineer Intern at Witness to Mass Incarceration, I developed an application showcasing businesses owned by formerly incarcerated individuals. I used React, TypeScript, Vite, and the Leaflet API to create an interactive map for users to explore these businesses. I also implemented unit testing using Jest to ensure application reliability.

🚀 Projects:
- **City Cares Locator:** A full-stack web application connecting individuals with unstable housing in NYC to over 50 homeless organizations. Built with React and Supabase, the app provides personalized search options and interactive map visuals.
- **MoviesRater:** A movie rating application developed with React and RESTful APIs, offering users a seamless browsing experience with user-friendly interfaces for rating and reviewing movies.

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on projects that make a positive impact and challenge me to learn new technologies and methodologies.
